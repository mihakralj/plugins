speedtest is an OPNsense wrapper for speedtest CLI and speedtest
binary test. It generates the CSV history of tests and can be included
in cron as a regular task.

This package is just a GUI wrapper and doesn't include the actual
speedtest package; if speedtest is not found, it offers instructions
to install either the implementation of http speedtest (from BSD ports)
or the TCP socket BSD speedtest provided by Oookla.
